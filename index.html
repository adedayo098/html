      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
              <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
               Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

      <header>What you should already known</header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

        A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
        Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, 
        try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p>

    <section id="JavaScript and java" class="main-section">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. 
        The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

    <section id="Hello world" class="main-section">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
         "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

    <section id="Function Declaration" class="main section">
      <header>Function declaration</header>
      <p>
         A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
         The name of the function.
         A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
         The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
         For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
  
         function square(number) { return number * number; }
         The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
  
         return number * number;</p>
    </section>
    <section id="While statement" class="main-section">
      <header>While statement</header>
         <p>
             A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
             while (condition) statement
             If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
             The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
        
             To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
        
             Example:
             The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        
             var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
             With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        
             After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
             After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
             After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
             After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

      <section id="Global Variable" class="main-section">
      <header>Global Variable</header>
       <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, 
        you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
